# 🧩 DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my **DSA repository**!  
This is my personal space for practicing, learning, and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** — one problem at a time 🚀  

---

## 🎯 About
This repository contains well-structured solutions to DSA problems written in **C++** (and occasionally **Python**).  
Each solution is focused on **clean code, optimized logic, and clarity** — designed to strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🔹 Arrays & Strings  
- 🔹 Linked Lists  
- 🔹 Stacks & Queues  
- 🔹 Recursion & Backtracking  
- 🔹 Trees & Graphs  
- 🔹 Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
- 🔹 Dynamic Programming  
- 🔹 Greedy Algorithms  
- 🔹 Bit Manipulation  

---

## ⚙️ Languages Used
-  **C+** (primary)  
-  **JAVA** (for select problems)

---

## 🚀 Goal
To build a **comprehensive DSA library** through consistent coding practice — improving logic, speed, and efficiency for interviews, contests, and real-world problem-solving.
